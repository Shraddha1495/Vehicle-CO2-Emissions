## About Project

The purpose of this project is to predict the CO2 emissions in Vehicle. The business problem this report addresses is the growing concern about the negative impact of CO2 emissions on the environment and human health. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, and it is essential to identify the major contributors and develop strategies to reduce them. The simple Linear and Multivariate regression model is built to analyse the CO2 emissions through evaluation metrics.
